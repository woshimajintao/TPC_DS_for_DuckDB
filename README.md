# TPC_DS_for_DuckDB
TPC-DS benchmark test for DuckDB
In this project, We have systematically learned the basic theories and concepts of TPC-DS bench-
mark testing and implemented it on DuckDB, which is an open-source and particularly fast database.
We finished the data and query generation. We conducted experiments for four scale factors on
eight tests: load test, power test, throughput test 1,throughput test 2, data maintenance test 1,data
maintenance test 2, data accessibility test, scalability test. It is evident that the execution time
grows linearly with the size of data. We also made performance optimizations on some queries,
which reduced their runtime by an order of magnitude of a thousand times. Then we presented
and analyzed the results of our experiments in figures and charts with data visualization.
